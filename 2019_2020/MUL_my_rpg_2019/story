The Cordyceps is a parasitic mushroom that causes cerebral infections among animals.
A parasitic scientist named Jenkison performed many experiments to understand how this
highly contagious parasite evolved in animals. These dangerous experiments led to
mutations of the parasite causing it to affect humans. A serviceman named Joel was sent
on a mission to the Somalian lab as a massive outbreak of the parasite led to hundreds of
people loosing their minds. It was found that violent symptoms of the parasite includes
the loss of sense and humanity in a mere couple of minutes followed by the urge to attack
anyone in proximity. Seeing the situation becoming uncontrollable Joel was recalled
immediately. On his way back Joel is informed that HQ has been infected and that 95
percent of the country will have been infected by the 3 day returns time it would take.
One of the highly infected regions includes his home where his 13-year-old daughter Sarah
and wife Rachelle reside. Worldwide communications are down Joel struggles to keep calm.
Everything is happening so fast, the world is becoming chaos. Joel returns starts his car,
plows highways as fast as possible. The country appears to have lost control, people are
seen infected on the streets. Joel rushes hoping they have not been infected. Once arrived,
he finds the infected neighbours in his daughters room with the window wide open. He knew
they had successfully escaped. He rushes out of the house chased by the unconscious infected
neighbours. Joel prepares by gathering essentials while fighting off the infected neighbours,
he runs as fast as he can. Joel gathers himself as he begins his search throughout the city
to find his family...
